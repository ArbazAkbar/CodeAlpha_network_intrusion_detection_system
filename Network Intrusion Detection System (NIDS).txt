3. Executive Summary
The Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) project aims to detect suspicious or malicious network activities by monitoring and analyzing network traffic. The project uses the Scapy library to capture and display network packets, focusing on TCP traffic. This report details the project's development, implementation, results, and future recommendations.
4. Introduction
Background
With the increasing prevalence of cyber threats, there is a growing need for effective network security measures. A Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) helps detect unauthorized or malicious activities on a network.
Purpose
The purpose of this project is to develop a simple NIDS that captures and analyzes network packets, identifying potential security threats.
Scope
The project focuses on capturing TCP packets over a specified network interface and displaying them for analysis. It does not include advanced features such as real-time alerting, intrusion prevention, or a user-friendly interface.
Audience
This report is intended for cybersecurity professionals, network administrators, and anyone interested in network security and intrusion detection.
5. Objectives and Goals
* Develop a basic NIDS using Python and the Scapy library.
* Capture and display TCP packets from a specified network interface.
* Provide a foundation for further development and enhancement of the NIDS.
6. Methodology
Project Plan
The project was implemented in several stages:
1. Setup and Configuration: Configuring the development environment and selecting the network interface.
2. Packet Capture: Implementing packet capture functionality using Scapy.
3. Packet Analysis: Displaying captured packets for further analysis.
Techniques and Tools
* Programming Language: Python
* Library: Scapy
* Network Interface: wlan0 (modifiable as per user requirements)
Data Collection
The system captures network packets in real time using the specified network interface and filter criteria.
Challenges and Assumptions
* Challenges: Handling high volumes of traffic and potential performance issues.
* Assumptions: The network interface is properly configured, and the user has the necessary permissions to capture packets.
7. Project Implementation
Development
The NIDS was developed using the following code snippet:
Python
import scapy.all as scapy


# Define the network interface to capture packets from
interface = "wlan0:"


# Define the packet capture filter (e.g., TCP packets only)
filter = "tcp"


# Start capturing packets
packets = scapy.sniff(iface=interface, filter=filter, count=100)


# Print the captured packets
for packet in packets:
    print(packet.show())


Testing and Evaluation
The system was tested by capturing TCP packets over a wireless network interface. The captured packets were displayed in the console for manual analysis.
Results
The system successfully captured and displayed 100 TCP packets, demonstrating its basic functionality as an NIDS.
8. Analysis and Discussion
Interpretation of Results
The system's ability to capture and display packets validates its core functionality. However, it lacks advanced features like automated threat detection and alerting.
Comparison with Objectives
The project met its primary objectives by successfully capturing and displaying network packets.
Lessons Learned
* The importance of efficient packet handling to avoid performance bottlenecks.
* The need for more advanced analysis tools and real-time threat detection capabilities.
9. Conclusion
The Network Intrusion Detection System project successfully demonstrated a basic approach to capturing and analyzing network traffic. While it provides a solid foundation, further development is required to enhance its capabilities and make it a more robust security tool.
10. Recommendations
* Future Enhancements: Implement real-time alerting and automated threat detection.
* Performance Optimization: Optimize packet capture and processing to handle high traffic volumes.
* User Interface: Develop a user-friendly interface for easier monitoring and analysis.
